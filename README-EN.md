# MSaaS
Microservice as a Service

---

## Project Goals

Microservice architecture offers flexible scalability and development processes, making it a crucial component of cloud-native applications. However, the intricate structure of microservices makes environment setup more challenging compared to monolithic architectures, significantly increasing the number of elements to manage.

You need to control numerous additional elements such as service-to-service communication, database management, API gateway configuration, and more. Moreover, you must set up complex infrastructure elements such as CI/CD pipelines for each service, monitoring systems, and distributed transaction management.

So, how should you start a microservice project? Using AWS and GCP from the beginning can be too overwhelming. The goal of MSaaS is to make it easy to implement the following requirements:

1. It should be possible to develop and deploy in a microservice architecture style within a local environment on a single server.
2. The local environment configuration should be easily transferable to a cloud environment.
3. The cloud environment should be easily customizable.
4. There should be an integrated UI to manage the above requirements.

## Status

### Phase 1 - Develop MSA structure in a local environment on a single server (Conceptualization in progress)
- [Google Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Pn_sIZzaloEOFWQTbgljlQDN4TfDoCU83-63zdzNnUU/edit#slide=id.p)

### Phase 2 - Automatically deploy the created MSA structure to K8S (Planned)

### Phase 3 - Easily customize the cloud environment (Planned)
